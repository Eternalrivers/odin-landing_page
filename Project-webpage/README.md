As port 22 is currently blocked on my network, I will use this chance to practice and make the project specified in the TOP project page.

In this project I will be demonstrating the knowledge I have acquired from the HTML course to CSS course. Once I complete this I can move on to javascript. Though I need to go back to the projects of the previous lessons once I have the opportunity to do so.

Looking back I have come a long way, but I must not be contented as I still have a long road ahead. In order to achieve the goals I set, a small sacrifice must be made.
